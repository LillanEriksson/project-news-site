# News Site 

This assignment was to create a news-site and learn to use flexbox. 

I chose a subject that I felt comfortable with so that I could focus more on the coding and design than the content.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I used flexbox for the section with articles, and for the big news section I used css grid. I wanted the text to lay on top on the pictures (but not on the big news), with a semi-transparent text background, a lot of googling was involved there. I had som problems with the responsive design, but I broke the problems into smaller bits and got piece by piece right.
I did the planning with Jambard and Trello.

Next time I will get the mobile-first design right and adding things as they ar needed. I will plan my design even better. And I will practice flexbox much more.
