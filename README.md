# News Site 

This assignment was to create a news-site and learn to use flexbox. 

I chose a subject that I felt comfortable with so that I could focus more on the coding and design than the content.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I used flexbox for the layout, learned a lot about positioning, getting things centered and getting things where I wanted them to be. I planned the whole thing in a Jamboard and collected the links and images I needed there.
I have a planning board in Trello so i can break down the project in smaller pieces.

Next time I will get the mobile-first design right and adding things as they ar needed. I will plan my design even better. And I will practice flexbox much more. So I don't need to do like I did now, restart the whole project 2 days before hand-in.
